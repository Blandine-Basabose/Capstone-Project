Module 1 - Create UI Templates
Timelines
Expected Length to Complete: 2 weeks
Module  Summary
You are required to create UI templates with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

NB: 
You are not implementing the core functionality yet, you are only building the User Interface elements, pages and views!
You are to create a pull request to elicit review and feedback for the UI template when you are done working on them
Do not download or use an already built website template.
Guidelines
On Trello, create user stories to set up the User Interface elements:

On the Trello board create stories to capture any other tasks not captured above. The tasks can be features, bug or chore for this module 1.
On a feature branch, create a directory called UI in your local git repo and build out all the necessary pages specified above  and UI elements that will allow the application function into the UI directory
Host your UI templates on GitHub Pages.
	Tip: It is recommended that you create a gh-pages branch off the branch containing your UI template. When following the GitHub Pages guide, select "Project site" >> "Start from scratch". Remember to choose the gh-pages branch as the source when configuring Repository Settings.
